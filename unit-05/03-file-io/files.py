# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# open the file (quantum.txt) in read mode and use a loop to print each line


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# create a new output file (e.g. outfile.txt) and write a few lines to it


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Open quantum.txt and outfile.txt together, and write the first word of each
# line in quantum.txt in CAPS to outfile.txt
#
# Hint: Use string methods to split the line into a list of words, and convert
# the first word to uppercase
