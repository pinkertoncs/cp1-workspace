# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# create a list. For example,a list of foods you like


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Iterate over the list with a for-loop and print each item, one per like
#
# for example, if my list was ["one", "two", "three"]
# the output is
# one
# two
# three
#


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Iterate over the list with a for-loop and print each item on a single line, 
# separated by commans
#
# for example, if my list was ["one", "two", "three"]
# the output is
# one, two, three


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Iterate over a list and print two-column tab-separated table with index and 
# item
# tip: use a single range-based for-loop, no need for nested loops
#
# for example, if my list was ["one", "two", "three"]
# the output is
# 0 one
# 1 two
# 2 three
#


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a list of lists and use a nested loop to print all of the lists, 
# one list per line. If you do this correctly, there will be no square brackets 
# in your output.
